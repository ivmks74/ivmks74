# Hi, I'm Mythreya 🔐

I am a **B.Tech Cybersecurity Engineering undergraduate** with a strong inclination towards **Blue Team operations**, including **SOC analysis, incident response, malware analysis, and digital forensics**. My journey in cybersecurity has been built through consistent hands-on practice, structured learning, and real-world security research rather than surface-level exposure.

## 🧠 About My Journey

I started by strengthening my **core computer science foundations**, particularly **networking, Linux, and operating systems**, and gradually moved into applied security. Understanding *how systems operate internally* helped me analyze *how attacks occur, how evidence is generated, and how defenders should respond*.

Over time, my focus shifted towards **defensive security workflows**, where I learned to think like a SOC analyst—correlating logs, identifying indicators, validating alerts, and documenting incidents with clarity and accuracy.

## 🛡️ Core Areas of Focus

### 🔹 Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Alert triage and prioritization  
- Log analysis across Windows and Linux environments  
- Identification of false positives vs real incidents  
- IOC extraction and case documentation  
- Investigation of phishing, brute-force attempts, malware alerts, and suspicious network activity  

### 🔹 Malware Analysis
- Static analysis using file metadata, hashing, and string extraction  
- Behavioral analysis of Windows malware in controlled environments  
- Identifying execution flow, persistence mechanisms, dropped files, and network callbacks  
- Mapping observed behavior to attacker intent and MITRE ATT&CK techniques  

### 🔹 Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
- Disk imaging and evidence acquisition using FTK Imager  
- Memory capture and analysis  
- Browser and system artifact examination  
- Structured forensic reporting aligned with investigation methodology  

### 🔹 Network & Detection Engineering
- Deep understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, and ARP  
- Packet-level traffic analysis using Wireshark  
- IDS-based detection using Suricata  
- Log correlation and alert analysis using Wazuh

## 🧪 Internship Experience — Cybersecurity Intern  
**Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad (IIITA)**  
*May 2025 – July 2025*

During my internship, I worked in a **security research lab environment**, where I conducted **deep technical analysis of embedded systems and firmware from a defender’s perspective**. My work required understanding system internals, execution flows, startup mechanisms, and the security implications of insecure design choices.

### 🔍 Key Contributions

- Performed **firmware extraction and reverse analysis** using Binwalk, SquashFS, and chroot environments.
- Analyzed **embedded Linux startup scripts and execution logic** to understand how system binaries are launched during boot.
- Identified and validated **root-level Remote Code Execution (RCE)** by abusing unsafe binaries and execution paths.
- Demonstrated **unauthenticated remote root shell access** using Netcat by launching shell listeners inside the firmware environment, proving full system compromise.
- Discovered **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via SD card manipulation**, where startup scripts allowed execution of attacker-controlled binaries mounted from external storage.
- Assessed **security impact, persistence risks, and lateral movement potential** in compromised environments.
- Documented findings through **detailed technical reports**, including proof-of-concept steps, exploitation flow, and defensive mitigation recommendations.

This internship significantly strengthened my ability to **analyze vulnerabilities beyond surface symptoms**, understand attacker abuse paths, and think critically about **secure system design and hardening**.

## 🧩 Projects & Practical Work

- **SOC Incident Investigations:**  
  Investigated simulated and lab-based SOC alerts involving Emotet malware, phishing campaigns, malicious URLs, and suspicious host behavior using SIEM-style workflows.

- **Suricata IDS with Wazuh Integration:**  
  Built a network intrusion detection environment, generated malicious traffic using attacker-victim labs, and analyzed correlated alerts, logs, and rule effectiveness.

- **Malware Analysis Labs:**  
  Conducted static and behavioral analysis of unknown Windows executables, extracting IOCs, network indicators, and execution behavior.

- **Digital Forensics Labs:**  
  Performed disk and memory investigations, analyzed system artifacts, and produced investigation-style reports.
